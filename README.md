# WI-DMV
Wanted to see what the hours looked like at various Wisconsin DMVs after they've been under fire for the voting laws. And work on some web scraping. Ran into an issue with forms and the way the site is structured and haven't solved that, so data is only there for counties with one service center. Written in Python, rewritten in R.
